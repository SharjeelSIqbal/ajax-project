# Shadow Deck
A web application for Yu-Gi-Oh! card players who want to build their own decks.
When I was younger my brothers and I would play _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ after school almost everyday. My older brother would win most of the time because he had a better deck, but it never stopped me from upgrading mine to be better. This app is meant to be a throwback to those nostalgic times, and build a deck from _any_ card that is available.
